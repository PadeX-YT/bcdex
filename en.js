    "article_sobre_el_creador_summary": "Hi, I'm José 'PadeX' 👋 and if you're reading this, you probably already know my application BCDeX, or at least it sounds familiar. In this post I want to tell you a little about the story behind the project. Because yes, although it may seem like a magic app that appears on your desktop and creates a bootable partition as if by magic... behind it there are many sleepless nights, failed tests and liters of coffee ☕.",
    "section_sobre_el_creador_2_title": "Learning by blows (and Google searches)",
    "section_sobre_el_creador_2_p1": "That's how I started working on automating the copying of the ISO directly from PowerShell. No need to mount it, no strange steps. Spoiler: it wasn't easy. I had to read a lot about ISO file structures, WIMs, extracting content directly without virtual drives... but in the end I managed to get everything to be done automatically.",
    "section_sobre_el_creador_2_p2": "So far so good. But I ran into another problem: the PowerShell console is not exactly the most user-friendly for many users. It's intimidating, it gives red errors, and it's not so clear what to do if something fails.",
    "section_sobre_el_creador_2_p3": "So I decided to take the next step: create a simple but functional graphical interface that would guide the user through the entire process —from creating the partition to copying the ISO and configuring the boot.",
    "section_sobre_el_creador_2_p4": "That's where what is now <strong>BCDeX</strong> was born.",
    "section_sobre_el_creador_3_title": "And where does the name \"BCDeX\" come from?",
    "section_sobre_el_creador_3_p1": "Once the application began to take shape, I needed a name. Something that reflected what it did, but also had a little personal identity.",
    "section_sobre_el_creador_3_p2": "That's where it occurred to me to combine two things: BCD, for the famous Boot Configuration Data that the app manipulates to create the Windows boot entries... and PadeX, which is the name of my YouTube channel, where I share many of these projects.",
    "section_sobre_el_creador_3_p3": "Thus the name BCDeX was born: a fusion of the technical and the personal. 😄",
    "section_sobre_el_creador_4_title": "And who is behind it?",
    "section_sobre_el_creador_4_p1": "As I told you before, I'm PadeX, and yes, I do everything: programmer, designer, tester, content creator and even technical support in the comments of my videos 😅.",
    "section_sobre_el_creador_4_p2": "Everything you see on this website, on the YouTube channel, and in the app, I do it myself (for now). With errors, with continuous improvements and with a great desire to keep moving forward.",
    "section_sobre_el_creador_4_p3": "BCDeX is not just a tool. It is the result of many tests, failures, learnings, and above all, an obsession to make life easier for anyone who wants to install Windows without complications.",
    "section_sobre_el_creador_5_title": "What's next?",
    "section_sobre_el_creador_5_p1": "Keep improving. I want to integrate new functions, such as post-installation optimizations, more compatibility, and some other surprise designed to leave your Windows ready and tuned from the first start.",
    "section_sobre_el_creador_5_p2": "That is why the support and contributions of those who use the app are also so important. Thanks to that I can continue to maintain the web, updating the tool and dedicating time to constantly improving it.",
